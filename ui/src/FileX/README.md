# FileX

Different from the file explorer feature that displays files within the editor UI, this feature contains all the code for a true file explorer similar to Windows.

A file explorer is a separate window that allows you to browse directories, create files, and more. However, instead of launching the built-in Windows Explorer, this feature opens our own custom file explorer.

Windows Explorer can be slow and clunky, and it doesn’t allow us to add custom features. FileX is essentially a separate project within the IDE, so we can reuse the APIs we’ve already defined.
