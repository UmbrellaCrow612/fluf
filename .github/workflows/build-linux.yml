        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Install dependencies for scripts
      - name: Install scripts dependencies
        working-directory: ./scripts

      - name: Ensure binman-linux is executable
        working-directory: ./desktop
        run: chmod +x ./node_modules/umbr-binman/bin/binman-linux

      # Step 6: Rename .env.example to .env for Desktop
      - name: Setup Desktop .env
        working-directory: ./desktop
        run: mv .env.example .env

      # Step 7 (Original Step 6 removed/skipped as the fix is Step 5)
